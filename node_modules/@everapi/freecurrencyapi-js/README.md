Creating a comprehensive `README.md` file for your `terraflow-lib` package is essential to help other developers understand how to use it effectively. Here's a detailed structure for your README, including installation instructions, examples, and key features.

# Terraflow-lib

**Terraflow-lib** is an npm package that simplifies currency conversion by utilizing the [FreeCurrencyAPI](https://freecurrencyapi.com/). This package allows you to fetch the latest exchange rates and convert between different currencies with ease.

## Features

- Easy-to-use function for converting between currencies.
- Automatically fetches real-time exchange rates.
- Supports multiple currencies with the FreeCurrencyAPI.
- Lightweight and fast for quick currency conversions.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install terraflow-lib
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the package in your project to perform currency conversions. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to get started:

### 1. Import the package:

```javascript
import { convertCurr } from 'terraflow-lib';
```

### 2. Set up FreeCurrencyAPI:

Ensure you have your FreeCurrencyAPI key. You can sign up [here](https://freecurrencyapi.com/) to get one. Once you have the key, initialize the API in your code.

```javascript
import Freecurrencyapi from '@everapi/freecurrencyapi-js';

// Initialize the FreeCurrencyAPI client
const freecurrencyapi = new Freecurrencyapi('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE');
```

### 3. Perform a Currency Conversion:

You can now use the `convertCurr` function to convert between two currencies. Pass in the base currency, the target currency, and the number of units to be converted.

```javascript
convertCurr("INR", "USD", 3).then(result => {
  console.log(`Converted amount: ${result}`);
});
```

### Full Example:

```javascript
import Freecurrencyapi from '@everapi/freecurrencyapi-js';
import { convertCurr } from 'terraflow-lib';

// Initialize FreeCurrencyAPI with your key
const freecurrencyapi = new Freecurrencyapi('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE');

// Convert 3 INR to USD
convertCurr('INR', 'USD', 3).then(result => {
  console.log(`Converted amount: ${result}`);
});
```

## API Reference

### `convertCurr(fromCurrency: string, toCurrency: string, units: number)`

#### Parameters:
- `fromCurrency`: (String) The currency code you are converting from (e.g., "INR").
- `toCurrency`: (String) The currency code you are converting to (e.g., "USD").
- `units`: (Number) The number of units of the base currency to be converted.

#### Returns:
A promise that resolves to the converted value.

### Example:

```javascript
convertCurr("EUR", "GBP", 100).then(result => {
  console.log(`Converted amount: ${result}`);
});
```

## Error Handling

The function includes basic error handling in case of:
- An invalid response from the API.
- Incorrect currency codes.
- Network-related issues.

Make sure to include a `.catch` block when using the function to gracefully handle errors.

```javascript
convertCurr("XYZ", "ABC", 5)
  .then(result => console.log(`Converted amount: ${result}`))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error during conversion:", error));
```
